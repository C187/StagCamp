				<p>At <span>Stag Camp</span> we've been welcoming the stranger to join us in the <span>Black Rock Desert</span> and beyond since 2007. Guided by the Stag Philosphy and Radical Self Reliance, Stag Camp has become the camp for people coming to the playa for the first time while providing a home for people with a few burns under their belts. </p>

				<h3>Foundraising for Stag Storage</h3>
				<p>Camp has a storage unit in Reno, NV where we store the shade, speakers, bars, and all the other camp fixtures donated by our wonderful Staggers. The unit was genesourlly paid for by Mack the last few years but he'll be unable to cover the cost for the 2016 - 2017 storage year.</p>

				<p>We need to raise $750 to cover the cost of the unit for a year. Any amount over our goal will be used for future years. If you are able to help out please do so <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
